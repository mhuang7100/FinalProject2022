Congratulations! You have just been hired by the US government to help uphold the totalitarian regime through censorship.
To guide you through this learning period, you'll need to complete a short tutorial before you take on full responsibilities of a
senior censorship officer. In each section, complete all of the required tasks in order to learn the essential skills you
will use to restrict the minds of the American people. Specifically, today you will be learning about ArrayLists. 

To begin, open the TaskOne.java file and follow the directions below.
You may have already learned about Arrays. ArrayLists are similar, but have a few key differences. Firstly, items in an
ArrayList can be added or removed using the .add() and .remove() functions. Run the program, then take a look at the code. 
Notice that the ArrayList is initialized as:
    ArrayList<datatype> array = new ArrayList<datatype>()
ArrayLists don't have to have a specific datatype unlike Arrays,
Notice that it also doesn't start with any values. Instead, the .add(element) function adds the values to the end of the ArrayList. 

Modify the portions of code that say "your code here" to complete the task, and check the key if you want to confirm your answer or
get help. 
The ArrayList in the code contains the names of blacklisted newspapers. 
1. The .size() method returns the length of an array, and the .get(index) method returns the corresponding element in an ArrayList.
Finish the "printArray" method so that it prints all of the newspapers in the blacklist. 
2. News just came in that the newspaper "Definitive Desserts" has been wrongly blacklisted! Remove this newspaper from the 
blacklist using the .remove(element OR index) method.
3. The owner of the popular "St. Louis Tribune" has recently published a story criticizing mint ice cream. The government
feels that this is an offense worthy of a spot on the federal blacklist. Add this newspaper to the blacklist using the 
.add(element) method.

After you completed all of the tasks, proceed to the Instructions2 file.
