Next, open the TaskTwo.java file and follow the directions below.
1. Make a method that detects badWords (found in the ArrayList) in an article title (String). It should return true if there is 
a badWord present and false if there isn't. 
2. Modify the method so that it also adds the article title to an ArrayList of goodArticles if it doesn't contain any badWords.
3. Modify the method so that it also removes the badWords from the article title
4. Modify the method so that it also replaces the bad words with the corresponding words from a different ArrayList with 
GoodWords. (ex: "bad" should be replaced with "good", and "incapable" should be replaced with "experienced")
